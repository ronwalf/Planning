Planning: 
An extensible Haskell framework for automated planning languages, paticularly PDDL.

The Planning package centers around extensible type safe expressions for
automated planning languages, modelled after Wouter Swierstra's Datatypes ala 
Carte[1].  Built around this are types describing PDDL, a PDDL parser and
serializer, and common utility functions, such as a negation normal form
transformation and variable replacement.
