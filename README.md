Planning: 
An extensible Haskell framework for automated planning languages, paticularly PDDL.

The Planning package centers around extensible type safe expressions for automated planning languages, modelled after [Wouter Swierstra's Datatypes ala Carte](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~wouters/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf).  Built around this are types describing PDDL, a PDDL parser and serializer, and common utility functions, such as a negation normal form transformation and variable replacement.

This is mostly a support library for my [HTN to PDDL translation program](https://github.com/ronwalf/HTN-Translation) plus several internal projects, thus its lack of decent tutorials and documentation.
